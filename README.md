# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files for setting up a Unix-like development environment.

## Included so far

- Zsh configuration
- Tmux configuration
- Neovim as a submodule

## Status

⚠️ This setup is still a work in progress.  
I plan to improve and add more tools (e.g. Git config, Vim plugins, etc.)
